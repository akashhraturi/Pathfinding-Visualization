# Pathfinding-Visualization

This Pathfinding Visualization project created by me using Python helps you find the shortest path between two points.
This project works on Informed Search Algorithm. We took the help of Heuristic Function to help us guide and figure out the correct path to go down.
It is much more efficient than BFS or DFS.
