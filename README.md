# Pathfinding-Visualization

This Pathfinding Visualization project created by me using Python helps you find the shortest path between two points.
This project works on Informed Search Algorithm. We took the help of Heuristic Function to help us guide and figure out the correct path to go down.
It is much more efficient than BFS or DFS.

Talking about this project, A* Search Algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path finding and graph traversals. The motivation behind this project was to approximate the shortest path in real life situations like in maps, games where there can be many hindrances. A* algorithm is an advanced form of Breadth first search. It avoids costly path and choose the most promising path. 

So I developed this project in Python and used Pygame to visualize it. Concepts that were used for it are A* Algorithm, Heuristic Function, Priority Queue, Manhattan Distance.

Applications - So one of the most widely used app worldwide or by me personally is Google Maps. Wherever I have to go I check the route on it. Google Maps uses A* Search Algorithm to get the shortest paths and alternate routes in real time. This Algorithm is also applied in various games like Warcraft 3, Tower Defense etc.

Limitations - Although being the best pathfinding algorithm around, it doesn't produce the shortest path always, as it relies heavily on heuristics/approximations to calculate it.
